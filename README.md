Angular-directives
==================

Even though I’m only a beginner with Angular, I thought I’d share some
of the directives I’m writing during my learning phase.

Currently in the repo:
<ul>
 <li>Checkbox group (chkGroup)<br>
<p>A directive to generate a set of checkboxes based on an array of objects.<br>
Returns a comma seperated list of id's.</p>
</ul>
